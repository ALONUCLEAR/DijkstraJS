DijkstraJS

# DijkstraJS
A website to visually demonstrate dijkstra, to help me and possibly others understand it better.
Inspired by my embarrasing lack of understanding of this algorithm and this video(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFg3u_E6eHU&ab_channel=SpanningTree) that encouraged me to face that hardship(we'll see if that motivation lasts).
